          ends that protrude into adjacent columns for better bonding. Confinement refers to the walls themselves, not their
          reinforcement. This method of construction is distinctly different from reinforced concrete frame with unreinforced
          masonry infill where the walls are constructed after the frame is built. Floors are constructed of either wood
          or reinforced concrete, and the roof is typically wood joist covered with shingles or tile. Gravity loads are resisted

          of the tilt-up walls. The tilt-up wall panels can be casted at the site, but more commonly, they are casted at
          a precasting plant. Tilt-up buildings are typically one story, but three story buildings of this type have been
          constructed. Tilt-up buildings are most commonly used for industrial occupancies, but they are used throughout

          30 feet long. Floors and roof for these buildings are either precast or cast-in place reinforced concrete elements.
          In constructing these buildings, the precast wall elements, with protruding reinforcing steel, are temporarily
          braced in final position leaving about a one foot gap between the wall panels. The reinforcing steel protruding
          from each of the four edges of the panel are attached to the adjacent wall element, to the foundation for bottom
          panels, and/or to horizontal floor or roof elements using either welding or mechanical reinforcement connectors.
          Finally, the one foot gap between the panels is filled with concrete. Gravity loads and lateral earthquake forces
          are both carried by the monolithic walls created in this construction process. This type of construction has not
          been used in the U.S., but it is very popular in Eastern Europe, and it has been used in Latin America.</td>

        <td>Telecommunication generally includes facilities constructed and equipped to receive and send voice, video, and data
          signals. The transmission medium can include metallic wire, fiber optic, or microwave. Buildings associated with
          telecommunication activities tend to be mid-rise (4-7 story) in height, but low-rise (1-3 story) and high-rise
          (8+ story) telecommunication buildings also exist. The most common construction materials used are concrete and
          steel. Equipment in telecommunication facilities is predominately switching gear. A variety of types of switching
          equipment is used, and these are typically mounted on banks of floor-to-ceiling racks that are installed in hundreds
          or thousands of square feet of space in a building.</td>
