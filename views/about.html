      <h1>Schedule of Values (SOV) Primary Characteristics Mapping Tool</h1>
        <h4>Project Scope:</h4>

      <p>
        Catastrophe modeling allows insurers and reinsurers, financial institutions, corporations, and public agencies to evaluate
        and manage catastrophe risk from perils ranging from earthquakes and hurricanes to terrorism and pandemics. Most
        re/insurers focus mainly on wind, earthquake, flood, and fire risk. To model risks, re/insurers use Risk Management
        Solutions’ RiskLink and AIR’s Touchstone applications. Re/insurers use these applications in two ways: probabilistically,
        to estimate the range or potential financial losses from catastrophes, and deterministically, to estimate losses
        from historical or hypothetical events.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4> Basic Framework for the AIR and RMS Catastrophe Model Consist of Four Main Components:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Event Module</strong> incorporates data to generate thousands of stochastic, or representative, catastrophic events. Each
          kind of catastrophe has a method for calculating potential damages taking into account history, geography, geology,
          and, in cases such as terrorism, psychology.</li>
        <li><strong>The Hazard Module</strong> determines the level of physical hazard the simulated events would cause to a specific geographical
          area-at-risk, which affects the strength of the damage.</li>
        <li><strong>The Vulnerability Module</strong> assesses the degree to which structures, their contents, and other insured properties are
          likely to be damaged by the hazard. Because of the inherent uncertainty in how buildings respond to hazards, damage
          is described as an average. The vulnerability module offers unique damage curves for different areas, accounting
          for local architectural styles and building codes.</li>
        <li><strong>The Financial Module</strong> translates the expected physical damage into monetary loss; it takes the damage to a building
          and its contents and estimates who is responsible for paying. The results of that determination are then interpreted
          by the model user and applied to business decisions.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h4>Project Motivation:</h4>
      <p>
        The impetus for this project is to develop an application that would assist catastrophe modelers in scrubbing a schedule
        of values obtained from an underwriter via a re/insurance brokerage firm. A schedule of values (SOV) contains locations
        for a particular account and each locations characteristic, e.g., coverage values, construction type, number of stories,
        year of construction, roof type, occupancy type, floor area, etc. The most important fields in a schedule of values
        to scrub and code are the occupancy type, year of construction, number of stories, and construction type because
        they have the most significant impact on the vulnerability module.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h4>Methodology:</h4>
      <p>
        To produce functions that would be able to successfully map a particular occupancy description to an ATC occupancy code,
        a construction or building description to an RMS or FIRE construction code, or a year of construction or a number
        of stories from a schedule of values, I needed review how analyst had historically coded these descriptions and make
        some intelligence decisions. I obtained a file from the catastrophe analysts, which contained an amalgamation of
        many schedule of values and their respective occupancy, construction, year of construction, and number of stories
        coding. The file contains approximately 22,466 records. I used these records to create mapping files or develop methodologies
        for coding appropriate primary characteristics.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h4>ATC Occupancy Code Mapping File Creation:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>For each ATC occupancy code, I used an SQL cursor to loop through the file and create an array of all of the occupancy
          descriptions which catastrophe-modeling analysts mapped them to that particular ATC occupancy code. This work was
          done in MSSQL. I used npm package msnodesqlv8, to create the SQL connection I also used the replace function to
          clean up any special characters.</li>
        <li>After I had successfully obtained a table with the ATC occupancy code in one field, and an array of all the descriptions
          analysts used to previously code a location that particular ATC occupancy code, I used a combination of node-rake,
          regular expressions, and filter method to create my final ATC occupancy-mapping table.</li>
        <li>The general idea was to create a more condensed array from these all of these descriptions. This would allow for
          the more efficient mapping. The npm package node-rake was very helpful in this process. RAKE is defined as Rapid
          Automatic Keyword Extraction. I used this package to extract the keywords from the descriptions. The regular expression
          was used to extract address information or other irrelevant numerical expressions. I used filter to ensure that
          we have distinct key words or key word pairs for mapping.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h4>RMS and FIRE Construction Code Mapping File Creation:</h4>
      <p>
        The RMS and FIRE construction code mapping file processes was similar to the ATC occupancy mapping file creation. This file
        did require a lot more manual manipulation as it was very messy.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h4>Number of Stories:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Two regular expressions were created to handle coding of the number of stories: one to ignore all information in
          parenthesis and one to extractt he max number in a given description </li>
        <li>A comprehensive review of the descriptions of the number of stories and the number of stories mapping indicated catastrophe
          modeling analysts rejected information in parenthesis and then selected the maximum value from a description of
          building heights.</li>
        <li>I also used prior knowledge to place some boundaries around the number of stories figures.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h4>Year of Construction:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Two regular expressions were created to handle coding of the year of construction: one to ignore all information
          in parenthesis and one to extract the max number in a given description</li>
        <li>I also used prior knowledge about the modeling vendors to place some boundaries around the year of construction figures</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h4>Project Design:</h4>
      <p>
        Since the technology to post entire files to a site and have it sent to a server is beyond the scope of this project and
        my current knowledge set, I chose to create a simple site that allows the user to turn a locations primary characteristics
        description into an array, paste that array to my site, and then my site will process the descriptions and return
        a list of those locations and their respective codes that will be appropriate to import into a catastrophe model.
        The site is very simple, but information produced from the site is very useful and significantly improves on analyst
        processing time. To choose the occupancy and construction codes, I use npm fuzzy-matching, which provides a “distance”
        variable from zero to one (0-1) which analysts can use to determine the reliability of the occupancy or construction
        code.

      <h4>Direction for Future Development:</h4>
      <p>This project is a start. My intent is to create a solution which will further reduce the catastrophe modeling analysts
        processing time. I, do however, realize the importance of human interaction with the schedule of values in making
        informed decisions. Moving forward, I would like to created a comprehensive tool where a catastrophe modeling analyst
        can spend a minimal amount of time massaging the schedule of values, import it into a tool, and then that tool will
        process the file and produce an import file for specific to any model vendor. Also, I would to incorporate functionality
        where the user can directly import the scrubbed file from my tool to the model vendor’s application.</p>
